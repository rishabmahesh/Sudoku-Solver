# Sudoku-Solver

About:
    This program finds an unique solution to any unsolved sudoku entered. 
    I have done this in a 2 step process. First, I search for the blank spaces which are straightforward ie, the correct number can be found very easily.
    Lastly, I have used backtracking via recursion to find the rest of the numbers. Backtracking is very fast, and efficient making it ideal for solving sudokus.

Skills Learned:
    This project involved a lot of debugging to nail the execution. To reduce the time taken, I implemented fill_single_values function, and completed the rest using backtracking     via recursion. I also learned some tricks while using lists in python.
